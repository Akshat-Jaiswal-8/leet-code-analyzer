# Leet Code-Analyzer
## Team Name: Solution Makers

## Problem Statement
In the dynamic landscape of programming education, there is a prevalent trend among aspiring developers to prioritize solving coding challenges efficiently, often neglecting the significance of writing clean and high-quality code. Popular platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Coding Ninjas focus predominantly on evaluating solutions based on time and space complexity, leaving the holistic code quality assessment unexplored.

### Key Objectives:

**Code Structure and Readability:**
Assess the clarity of variable names.
Evaluate the organization and structure of the code.
Provide feedback on adherence to coding conventions.

**Comments and Documentation:**
Identify the presence and quality of comments within the code.
Evaluate the effectiveness of documentation, if any.

**Duplicacy and Redundancy:**
Detect redundant code segments or unnecessary repetition.
Provide suggestions for optimizing and refactoring where applicable.

**User-Friendly Integration:**
Seamlessly integrate with LeetCode or other coding practice platforms.
Ensure ease of use, requiring minimal effort from the user.

**Scalability and Flexibility:**
Design the extension to accommodate future updates and improvements.
Allow flexibility for integration with additional coding platforms.


## Problem Solution
This project aims to address the evolving needs of the programming community and align with the expectations of major MNCs and product-based companies.

By emphasizing not only the efficiency of code but also its overall quality, the Code Quality Evaluator seeks to instill good coding practices in aspiring developers.

This initiative aligns with the industry's growing emphasis on holistic assessments during recruitment, ultimately bridging the gap between efficient problem-solving and writing production-ready code.

The challenge is to develop a Chrome extension that enhances the coding practice experience on platforms like LeetCode by introducing a comprehensive code quality evaluation system. 

The extension should analyze the code submitted by users, providing feedback on various aspects of code quality beyond just efficiency metrics.
